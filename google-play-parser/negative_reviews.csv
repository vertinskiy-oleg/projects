Messenger is a free app to help users open their favourite Messenger & Social Media applications with only one click.
With Messenger, you can even open Non-installed messenger apps with built-in webview function, which saves a lot of storage space.

com.picoo.sms,2016-01-02 07:50:48,Old vault was better. Now am paying for something that will only hide photos and forced to use this substandard text messaging app. I must put all my private contacts in one at a time & still does not hide messages. Most names or photos will not attach to the telephone numbers so  have no idea who is texting unless I manually add them again! Also notification volume is now separate so you must go into that app and adjust the volume separatly from main volume.  No fwd. anyone know of a better app than Vault?,1,346,
com.picoo.sms,2016-05-31 19:29:32,Doesn't allow your keyboards functions to work properly. Always autocorrecting my words no matter how many times I change it back and no way to add to dictionary anymore within app?? Really?? No issues outside of this app with same keyboard. All functions work just fine. And this has the worst delete button ever made. Deletes one letter at a time and only up to the first letter of the word. STUPID STUPID STUPID!! Please allow normal functions instead of overriding your own crap.,1,99,

com.picoo.sms,2016-10-29 20:21:05,Old vault was better... This is a just waste of money and time doesn't hide my private contacts and messgaes even i have purchased the premium version still not working... Every one upgrade their app for good result but u has made this horrible,1,3,
com.picoo.sms,2016-01-04 05:33:25,Needs to be fixed!! Gets senders wrong.  Gets all mixed up. Can't figure out who actually sent a text. Does not work at all with photos that are received. Always seems to be from my fav's.  Not cool. Very frustrated. Cant  count on it.,1,12,
com.picoo.sms,2016-03-03 09:41:38,Interface is ok and simple. However here's the list of some things he that need major work: 1. Military time needs to go. 2. MMS does not work well at all. 3. When used with Vault private SMS feature the MMS messages are not blocked and go through to this app. Defeats the whole purpose when we are forced to use this app with Vault and 4. No emojis functions??? Really? If vault didn't force us to use this sms app it would have been deleted a long time ago.,1,18,

com.antiland,2019-05-01 08:59:39,The app itself is fine. My issue is with all the mods power tripping and banning people without checking if its bannable offense. They should also remove the appeal feature because it does nothing. Like what's the effin point of having an appeal feature when they're just goin to ignore you? A total waste of time. The app is fun but it ruins the experience with stuck up mods eager to ban people just because. Not gonna recommend to anyone,1,40,"Dear Client,

You arent even able to type the word Kick amongst many other words as it gets blocked. No mention of 3rd party apps is absolutely the most nazi esque rule Ive seen on a social media platform. This could be a great little app. unfortunately it just makes me want to try at a far more polished version myself with the only rules being the typical norm youd expect.,1,6,"Dear Client,

com.antiland,2020-02-11 16:09:10,I would give zero stars if I could. This app is horrible. It's so heavily censored I feel like I am in North Korea. The users that flock here are mostly rude and it's impossible to get to know anyone if you're new. So-called regulars of the room will ignore you or judge you harshly if you don't fit in. People here obsess over gifts and animal attire which can b purchased (microtransactions) and it's such a pathetic cash grab. I recommend going out in the real world and avoid this fyre festival.,1,0,"Dear Client,

com.chatous.chatous,2018-10-22 23:27:02,A wasteland of idiots with no social skills. This app needs to be changed to that it encourages social behavior. Perhaps by requiring that each user to maintain an average of 5 minutes of social interaction with each person they connect to. And the social interaction needs to be mutually agreeable so each chat should be rated by both parties after it is over. Users who don't maintain an average of 5 minutes of mutually-agreeable social interaction with each person they are connected to only get connected other people like them. But users who maintain an average of 5 minutes of mutually agreeable social interaction with each person they are connected to should be able to filter out connecting to those who don't.,1,179,

I choose it because of both manual and cloud recording which it claimed. Then NO customer support after TWO DAYS! DO NOT USE! WORSE THAN ZOOM! Despite their response they responded TWO days later NOT TWO HOURS! It was so bad that I had to get on Twitter to complain to them. This company is a liar! Their pricing is clear NOW but it wasn't when I decided to use them. They only changed it up after I gave them a one star. Plus, it's moronic. Who wants to use a webinar/meeting service that they CAN'T record? Plus, why would I pay for a recording when I CAN'T tell how the recording is going to sound? I'm NOT paying for piss poor quality sound recording! No ONE with good sense would! So AGAIN, I said what I said and I recommend that NO ONE USE THEM!

Desktop program for Windows does not allow other users to take over the 
whiteboard. It gives the option to accept or decline but when you click on 
accept, nothing happens. Also there is no option to disable video of other 
participants on desktop but it is available on the Android app. And the 
biggest problem is that there is no option for landscape or full screen 
whiteboard on both desktop and Android. Was willing to subscribe but not 
with these faults",1,0,"Hi there,

Thank you for your feedback.

For the whiteboard issue, you can enable annotation so that others can write on it.

Why do I connect to a meeting, then also have to initiate a connection to the voice service? That's just poor functional design. Connecting me to a meeting should automatically connect me to the voice call. Finally, why the heck does audio chat not work over mobile data? THE WHOLE POINT OF A MOBILE APP IS USING IT ON THE GO.

air.com.adobe.connectpro,2020-03-19 19:08:12,The app doesn't really work. One of the biggest issues for me was the fact that if you connected your microphone (which I needed to do for class) it disconnected my headphones and then created a feedback loop. There was no way to have it recognize the headphones again and so the meeting would be blasting through the phone with no way for me to interact besides the chat function.,1,39,
air.com.adobe.connectpro,2020-03-02 09:58:34,"At the first time I used the app for my virtual university class there was no surprise for me that the app is such Low rated. Currently it has lots of problems. To begin with the worst it just doesn't let me to rotate the view so it makes my phone cover stand is useless. This was the most annoying part of it. Second is that for my class our names are in Persian(which is written Right to Left), but the app couldn't show the attendee names correctly. Just hated it at all!!!",1,299,
air.com.adobe.connectpro,2020-01-29 06:09:25,"Awful app. Poorly optimized with a lot of amateur coding mistakes. Such as not being able to see what you're typing, or even being able to erase it without have to back out of chat. Sound can be choppy and inaudible for no apparent reason, so even doing nothing but listening can be a challenge. Lots of other dumb issues that makes me surprised the app even functions at all. It's nothing more than a garbage mobile version of Adobe Connect. Please just use the desktop version instead.",1,143,
air.com.adobe.connectpro,2020-03-17 23:38:13,"Adobe needs to hire some UI/UX developers. EDIT: First of all I'm not talking about the website Adobe connect using which is way better than this app, needles to say that THIS APP needs some improvements. 1- it doesn't support rtl languages in the comment section like Arabic, Persian etc 2- it has very basic options comparing to html based version 3- colors are absolutely terrible, for me it was surprising how a company like adobe had made something like this. 4- there is a 500 char limit ..",1,8,Can you please share which parts of our interface you found difficult to use?

App review - If someone reports you then your account will be suspended without complete investigation of the issue. If you are suspended then you will not get any opportunity to present your case. This policy is against consumer protection legislations. Paid subscriptions become useless during suspension. Azar's method to review the reports is incomplete and hence flawed. Azar should do holistic review by listening to audio of both sides.,1,218,"Sorry for the inconvenience. There are some reasons for being suspended from Azar, such as hateful and discriminatory speech, indecent exposure and/or profile photo, and other inappropriate behaviors. You can see your suspension period and the reason why you have been banned from our service if you select the ""World-icon"" tab.

com.tencent.mm,2020-03-02 05:55:09,They seem to block users as they wish especially foreigners for minor things and they don't reply or give you feedback ever when asked. Very poor communication. Never never replied. Time to get rid of app.,1,11,

I'll just use Whatsapp instead lol",1,71,
com.tencent.mm,2020-02-20 23:52:09,"Terrible Experience. Used to have a 3-year-old iPhone 7 and wechat ran smoothly. Right now on a middle range Android (supposedly comparable performance to an old iPhone) WeChat is slow and laggy. Worse yet, WeChat is known for building a monopoly of an IM in China, which helps the censorships and spreading propoganda and fake news by banning users and content creators. We Chinese can hardly walk out of this trap, so if you can, avoid getting you, your love ones and your friends into this wicked ecosystem of WeChat. Choose from Signal, Telegram, Threema, Wire etc. for a more privacy friendly experience.",1,16,

Messenger is a free app to help users open their favourite Messenger & Social Media applications with only one click.

I had considered buying it at this point now I wouldn't give you a nickel for it whenever you guys did you f***** it up Royally,1,40,"Hi Jerry,

Sorry to hear that you experience inaccurate location registration. Perhaps you have disabled the GPS on your device? An upgrade to Android 8 (if available) might be another option. By the way, no user data is shared with any third party and all your user data is automatically deleted 1 month after uninstalling HangOut.

com.myyearbook.m,2020-03-15 02:52:11,So my account was flagged because a bot got into my account. So when I try to open my account it sends me to the website to verify.

Either give me a way to cancel my account or figure out a way to let me back in. This is absolute insanity.,1,8,"Hi there!
