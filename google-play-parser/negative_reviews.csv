com.audioaddict.di,2019-08-24 21:42:20,"With the 2019 August release the app just got more awkward.   Not only is navigating to the playlists very cumbersome, exiting the app is now harder .

The app has gone backwards in my opinion.  I love digitally imported but for a very progressive selection of music I can't understand why they can't get the simple parts of the technology designed better as this is the only interface we have to use on our phones to listen in the car, earbuds, etc.     This needs to be a priority fix.     If it weren't for the complex navigation I'd give this more STARS, but as much as I listen I have to go through an unnecessary amount of clicks to navigate, especially to close it.

com.mobile.radionomy,2017-09-15 18:03:26,As somebody had previously pointed out I was forced against my will to use this buggy unfinished product due to the fact that radionomy will no longer allow it stations to be listened to using standard streaming apps aside from the fact that this is simply an unethical and completely dick move the kind of defeats the whole point it's like saying that I can only listen to your station if I buy a very specific brand radio for my car it doesn't make sense but due to the incredibly serious flaws in your app such as the continuing crashes every single time the phone switches cell phone towers or experiences a temporary Network disruption as well as the fact that the now playing page only shows the station name and doesn't include basic information on the songs and there's this little thing called an equalizer have you heard of it?

The app and a regular physical radio work differently. Regular radio works using radio waves (short signal) and apps use Internet waves (longer reach) and you can listen to stations from all over the world. This means you need an Internet connection for this.You can use it just with wifi if you wish.

The app and a regular physical radio work differently. Regular radio works using radio waves (short signal) and apps use Internet waves (longer reach) and you can listen to stations from all over the world.

The app has never worked well. podcasts will not download so you have to stream them. When streaming it stops playing every 10 minutes or so. A real hassle in the car. But I've always just grinned and bared it because I need my Rush fix. Now the app literally shuts down my car's audio system everytime I try to stream. It is now a completely unusable app. Sadly I am canceling my subscription.,1,10,
com.premiereradio.android.rushlimbaugh,2019-08-14 21:36:38,Don't get me wrong. I've been a full on ditto head for 30 years. This app for Android however is the worst app I've ever had. It's painstaking slow. It crashes every hour - sometimes even more often. It doesn't matter if I try to stream or download the podcasts it still crashes. Maybe the version for Apple works but this one is abysmal and most certainly not up to Rush's excellent standards. Whoever did the front end design did a great job but just being pretty is never enough. Please fix this.,1,57,

It looks like it was created by a college freshman designer who crammed every flashy effect and feature they could think of into it. End result is a buggy unusable pile of steamy goo that attempts to do many things but fails at all of them. It is especially inept at letting you listen to Rush. I do not want a portal to the website that pukes all available content at me. I want an audio player that is not a danger to myself or others when I try to control a podcast with it.

com.brainfm.app,2019-04-24 23:37:39,Edit: The app is dead. Support doesnt answer. Nothing buffers. Try another app.   Edit: Updating my review again. This went from a 4 star application (buffering issues and limited sound options kept it from being a 5) to a 1 star useless application. The app no longer buffers for me. At all. Even worse I've messaged the support email a handful of times over the last two weeks and have received no response. The app is dead. It does not work. There is no support. Do not buy it.   Edit: App never buffers anymore. Even when it did buffer it would pause and have random gaps. I want to like this app because it looks and feels great but its just useless. worse than useless. I cant believe I paid for a lifetime membership. Is that fraud?  Edit: Brain.fm responded to me saying they respond faster if I email their support email. I've send them 6+ email to that address. Clear lies.,1,13,"Hey Taylor, apologies for poor support and app experience. We understand its frustrating, and we've made changes in our support and development processes in response to user feedback.

Only DJ should decide bans.,1,3,"I understand your frustration, and I think this is a great point - we will pass this feedback on to our developers and see what we can do!

com.infoshell.recradio,2016-04-19 09:10:21,"The title of the app is misleading .  When you search for an app with similar title you expect that you find an app recoding radio sound. But instead this app has just a limited number of radio stations streaming with very limited selection of music genres. When searching for this app I was looking for an app which can record the radio station which I already play on my android phone , or out of other sound source. ( in other words, multi tasking capable voice recorder ... Which can record music when the app is working on the back ground and is not active on the main screen. This app is just a virtual radio station which is not brave enough to list or state the music genre which it broadcasts. For the misleading app name I would have given rating : ""0"" stars out of ""5"" stars possible.",1,0,

com.cloudbeats,2018-10-03 21:53:21,"Yes, I can stream one album at a time, but the whole reason I purchased this was so that I could stream my entire 27,000 song library from Microsoft OneDrive...on random shuffle.  Guess what?  It either doesn't work at all with Android (all of the help tutorials are for the iPhone) or it can't handle very large libraries (though mine is hardly the largest).  And if I could at least create a playlist, that would be acceptable.  But everytime I add songs to the list and tap the playlist, it shows up as empty even though it says there are say, 17 songs in the list.  So I can't even do that.  Getting it to ""read the metadata"" is probably a critical thing, but when I try to get it to read all 27,000 songs it konks out after less than a minute.

com.cloudbeats,2018-12-12 05:58:44,"This app does NOT perfectly replace the MS Groove app. Firstly, when selecting my Onedrive music folder for scanning, nothing is found (it even said that 0 files were queued for scanning!). As another user said, the folder has to be opened and a track played before it's added to the database, including artwork. Secondly, there is no filter to seperate locally stored music. When switched off, it shows music from BOTH local and online music. Switching it on filters out online music, so only locally stored music is shown, the reverse of what should happen. What the app should do is sign into the online storage provider, choose your music folder, scan it into the database and then select the filter to only show music stored online. That is what the Microsoft Groove app did! EDIT: Developer replied to my review. I used 'scan folder' but that does not show the album art. Album art on all my music is embedded into the music file using MP3Tag. Only time it is imported is if I play a track from the album. Needless to say, it looks like a total mess! With regards to the filter switch comment, then it's not like Groove at all then is it?

com.mixcloud.player,2020-01-22 15:53:30,I would give it 5 star becuase i use this app everyday to listen to my faviorite radio show. But to be honest the app sucks. It crashes and freezes all the time. One time i couldnt get it to respond and even after closing the app it contuined to play music over all other apps. I had to take my battery out to resovle. So if dev team takes some time to make this app run smoother on android then 5 star app day long. Till then its a subpar app that works way better on desktop.,1,0,"Hi, sorry to hear you‚Äôve been experiencing some crash issues.

My issue with the app is that they get the kids all excited about making their stickers and heart heroes come to life with the augmented reality part of the app. Then it turns out that not all phones are compatible with that feature. I downloaded the app last year because she was desperate to use that feature. It worked last year. Now this year it says my device (same phone) is not compatible. Not all of us get new phones every year or 2.

If I did happen to have a party big enough to be able to use this app, you expect me to explain to each person as they arrive that they have to download, install, and set up a brand new app?

com.leviton.home,2019-01-10 07:55:39,"The new update seems to focus on looks, not function or usability.

com.leviton.home,2019-10-06 05:12:11,The app has not worked properly for months and I've uninstalled it and reinstalled it and reset my Leviton multiple times. Big waste of money since I had to have an electrician install it because it's on a 3 way switch.,1,4,
