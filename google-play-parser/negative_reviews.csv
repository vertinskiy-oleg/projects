com.streamlabs,2020-01-02 17:14:44,"Streamlabs was always buggy. You'd have to set everything up twice for it to register, overlays would show on stream as black boxes, etc. These were acceptable because it was a free app that they were supposedly working on. Instead of fixing these known issues they decided to strip functionality unless you buy a subscription to get back to the broken app that used to be free. Worse than that even, when you buy the subscription the new version of the app has more bugs than before they instituted the forced pay system. While I can gratefully accept a free app that has known problems, I can't stomach paying hundreds of dollars for a worse version of the same app. Especially knowing that Streamlabs has no intention of giving us a better experience. They only plan to charge more money for it. I am currently exploring other streaming options. I'm off of Streamlabs on my PC as well due to their decisions with the mobile app. Edit to respond to Streamlabs: It's the alerts and overlays that cause me the most problems. For example, if I put an alertbox on my stream on your mobile app and then go live the alertbox shows up as a black box in the middle of the screen for my viewers. The alerts don't show in there, it's just a black box in the middle of the stream. If I go back into the Editor and back to the stream it goes away, sometimes. The last time I tried to use your app I went back and forth three times and the box still wouldn't go away. It has nothing to do with the camera source, though that is another problem. Sometimes with the new version it's impossible to get the camera source to go fullscreen. Another problem is that custom url overlays don't work anymore. Honestly, there are too many problems to list in this format, and trying to contact StreamLabs directly doesn't go anywhere.",1,6,"Update: It seems you are having issues with your phones webviews. Unfortunately this is out of the scope of the app for us to able to fix. Sorry for the inconvenience, hopefully a future operating system update will fix your issues."

com.streamlabs,2019-12-19 05:29:06,"I used Streamlabs Mobile app to stream my IRL cycling trips. It was working great, I loved it. Then they introduced the latest update and nothing works anymore. I don't mind the watermark and everything, but I was not able to stream from my camera anymore; the app keeps asking to ""capture the entire screen"", even though all I wanted was to stream what is captured by my camera. The camera also shows up as a black rectangle after adding it to the scene. The only way to fix that is to switch to front cam and back... but yeah, things worked very smoothly before the update. it's sad to say that I now have to look for another app to stream from. Hopefully things are fixed, maybe then I will change the score. 1 Star ======EDIT====== Seems like they did a small update that fixed the black screen for camera. I will test out and update more.

Mobcrush is not compatible with it since it does not have screen record which is key for Mobcrush to work and stream. Sorry about that either update to 5.0 or higher Android or get a new device.

com.shopify.pos,2018-01-23 06:25:16,"Terrible. I got the ap, and started using it took a lot of credit cards. The day before my last day of free trial period, I got two of my payments in my account. All of a sudden my account was on hold, and my money being held. I called customer service they stated then that they needed a voided check, and id.  I send it in then wait they still don't release my money almost 125.00. Customer service is no help. Mind you they already gave me two payments, so I'm confused. I call a third time and speak to Michelle she is clueless and absolutely no help. And tells me if they don't release the money to me they will send it back to the customer. I have a small carryout and the customers have already received their goods so sending money back to them is not an option.  I ask to speak to a supervisor and an told they do not speak to. Customers, they will email of neccessary.  So mad not not sure what else to do. I am a small company and them keeping my payments not good. Very shady company  UPDATE  AS  of today 1-19-18 I keep calling the customer service. Jason yesterday tells me to keep on touch with him and he assured me on the phone I would get a resolution. I get an email from Charlie last night that stares they need my drivers license again to process everything. So I again send it in, and get an email from Jason this morning stating not to contact him again but contact Charlie.  SMH the company is holding 200.00 dollars in money from my sales and is giving me the run around to get it. And this is the trial period. They tell me if you pick a plan you wouldn't be going through this. If I'm getting this kind of run around durning the free trial, how am I supposed to chose a plan and believe that I would get my money. Terrible. And the customer service is nothing to brag about Update---------- As of 1-22-18 still no money. Just emailed customer service and told them I will be contacting my attorney. They wanted a copy of my business license which I provided. This is getting ridiculas. They should be no reason why after all I submitted that I can't get my deposits. And they still are requesting I chose a plan SMDH.",1,6,"Hey Lisa,

Sorry to hear about your experience with our POS.

It auto tracked vs. me having to remember to turn it on every time I wanted to record. It wasn't as accurate as needed but this is waayyy off. I'm not getting most of my data because I have the remember to turn it on. My weight isn't automatically received from my scale. There's no place to add notes about the day/exercise, etc. There's no place to track food. In an effort to make this simple, you've made it useless. Removing and looking for something better. Update 2/17/2020: Gave it another try with a different tracker -- FitPro. A much simpler tracker and still GoogleFit can't keep up! To add injury to insult my back up plan -- syncing my phone to my medical plan's app isn't working either. My AARP health plan gives me incentives to count my steps with a tracker or my phone! The app won't sync and I have a GOOGLE phone! What on Earth??? I give up. I really wanted this to work. I believe in tracking my steps and, in spite of a physical disability, I challenge myself to walk 10,000 steps or more every day no matter what. It's very rewarding on days when I'm really struggling to ""beat"" my own record but I have to have reliable data to know I'm doing that! This is discouraging.

Whenever I choose an exercise plan in the premium section nothing works. The videos are all incomplete. Halfway through the workout I have to stop because the screen goes black and doesn't show which exercise I'm supposed to do next. As a result, the tracking timers go haywire, so I'm not even sure how long I've been doing an exercise. The premium plans section is confusing and frustrating to navigate. Even trying to do the basic ""Fitness test"" does not work, as again, it's missing several videos and trying to skip through one breaks the videos/tracking for time and reps.

com.emdigital.jillianmichaels,2018-12-16 02:42:58,"Update: Cannot mute Jillian's voice interrupting my podcast player. Irritating. // Reply: Thanks for the note on the weekly meal balance. That's not stated in the app. Also, being aware of my micronutrients is just a responsible habit. To call it being ""bogged down by numbers"" is condescending and not appreciated. // OG Review: UX feedback. meal planning needs work. When I repeatedly dislike suggested meals, it eventually just stops suggesting. Half the time nothing happens when I hit the refresh button. It doesn't maintain a daily calorie count, one breakfast is 150 cals, the next is 400. Could end up with a 800 or a 1600 calorie day. / When viewing the recipes list, make ones I disliked greyed out (like the image is in the recipe). When backing out of a recipe, don't take me back to the top of the list and make me scroll back to my place. It should be sticky. // I don't recommend for meal planning. Can't view macro/micronutrients. I could follow the plan, disliking things, and be low in vitamins and minerals without it being intelligent (or transparent) enough to alert me. Dr Gregory's daily dozen or Cronometer is more useful to be balanced.",1,5,"Thanks for the feedback. For your calorie example, the changes in the day stretch across the week. A single day may go high or low but overall it stays in balance. Same thing with macro and micro nutrients.

We're sorry for the inconvenience you faced. As you're aware that Google Fit's internal algorithm removes steps for non-moving activities such as driving, biking, etc. This is the reason why you see a mismatch between Google Fit and TWC steps. You can read more about the same here - https://developers.google.com/fit/faq#get-step-count"

com.google.android.apps.fitness,2020-02-17 10:33:39,"I liked the old version. It auto synced with my Walgreens apps. The old version was intuitive. It auto tracked vs. me having to remember to turn it on every time I wanted to record. It wasn't as accurate as needed but this is waayyy off. I'm not getting most of my data because I have the remember to turn it on. My weight isn't automatically received from my scale. There's no place to add notes about the day/exercise, etc. There's no place to track food. In an effort to make this simple, you've made it useless. Removing and looking for something better. Update 2/17/2020: Gave it another try with a different tracker -- FitPro. A much simpler tracker and still GoogleFit can't keep up! To add injury to insult my back up plan -- syncing my phone to my medical plan's app isn't working either. My AARP health plan gives me incentives to count my steps with a tracker or my phone! The app won't sync and I have a GOOGLE phone! What on Earth??? I give up. I really wanted this to work. I believe in tracking my steps and, in spite of a physical disability, I challenge myself to walk 10,000 steps or more every day no matter what. It's very rewarding on days when I'm really struggling to ""beat"" my own record but I have to have reliable data to know I'm doing that! This is discouraging. I really thought, by now, Google would have a better handle on this. I actually thought, they might even have their own device but for them to not be able to get their own phone to sync the app correctly with medical apps and devices that are partnering with Google is shameful! Oh well. I guess I can always try the old abacus and pray I don't fall in a hole while I'm walking with my service dog down the street trying to manipulate little beads on tension rods or (even worse) lose my count and have to start all over again!

I uninstalled the app and then was just curious if the app had my credit card on file so I reinstalled. Imagine my surprise to see that I was to be billed $149 on the 2nd of Feb! First of all a one year subscription is $200 and monthly is $60 so why does this default to$149 for 6 months?! There is no option to unsubscribe. You have to talk to your coach! The coach was a total joke. This entire app is a waste.,1,95,

There is also no function that allows you to establish a correlation between calorie intake, your excercise and your weight loss/gain.

This new version is still extremely glitchy. e.g. - whole sections of saved feeds simply disappear (deleted randomly) - multiple (up to 6) copies of the same story appear - many sites (e.g. Yonhap news) will never load new stories - broken interface for arranging feeds (they do not move/arrange) - new stories do not appear (until after you flip back and forth between folders) - after hitting 'read all' a new set of stories loads...i.e. the button to empty the in-box instead fills it. ??? - will not recognize google news topics unless forced to - no 'light/dark' mode interface - very hard on eyes - disable auto-load pictures doesn't work some good new features such as settings: - export-import and folders of feeds are excellent. - no more lag for recieving and deleting stories (good),1,5,
net.frju.flym,2018-08-16 20:43:01,"I don't know why my review disappeared after the developer responded to 
message. There is something very fishy going on, and I would caution users 
to stay away from both apps. The old version is unsupported with no good 
explanation. And the new version has no features to make it significantly 
different than the old one and in fact Works worse. I think the new version 
is spying on users.",1,0,"I know the v2 does not have yet all the v2 features, that's why I forced nobody to switch, you can still use the v1 if you prefer. However the v2 has a better code base and is clearly the future from my point of view.

So in reality, even though I liked it at first, the app was never any more than complete garbage. It doesn't filter anything properly; it doesn't always notify you when someone responds to a comment; you can't share an article with someone who doesn't have NR, without first opening it in your browser, which requires a half-dozen steps to perform through the app; the comments for an article don't actually matter in the long run, aside from starting flame wars, because they aren't on the article's page; sometimes articles don't load properly; sometimes replies to comments don't include the mention; more often than not, the community on NR is quite toxic.

You can't for example change the sequence of tasks within a goal, so you have to add them in the order that you want to do them.

com.trantrigroup.note,2018-11-24 17:23:38,"Actually, let me amend this. This app is dangerous. It's phishing.

com.trantrigroup.note,2018-12-05 00:17:05,It was great untill it started using forced pop up adds. Not even useful adds those stupid you have won blah blah blah adds. So disapointing.

Thanks for your feedback.

The ads are the way for us to keep the app up to date and working on all new devices. The reason you are experiencing the ads so often is because of the Caller ID function which is integrated in the app. So calls wake up the ads.

I didn't realised that they had permission for all my basic services like Call Log, Media storage etc. They had consumed my 450mb data in 3 months and used it in background.

Thanks for your feedback. I can confirm that we don't scan or have access to any of your personal info.

The reason we ask for these permissions are for the Caller ID and Spam Detection functions to work properly. These are core functions in the app, and will simply not work without these permissions.

Thank you for your feedback. As the app is free we need advertising to cover the cost of maintaining & updating it.

I tried making entries through the phone keyboard (Moto G6 Play phone).  It took forever for the interface to appear.   And then there is a set of symbols at the top of the screen....but no explanation as to the function they perform.   I looked for a manual that describes how to this product.   Can't seem to find one.   I guess I am too stupid to understand the inuitiveness of the interface.   Gee I only have a masters degree from a top 10 engineering school.

That is such an obnoxious deal breaker for a note taking app. To say that you have ONE JOB is hardly an exaggeration. No single update should be worth potential lost work or research.

com.albul.timeplanner,2019-07-23 03:33:54,péssimo,1,0,Geisi maybe you have some proposals to make the app better? :)
net.wifitimetracker,2019-08-08 09:09:10,barely works with Android 9. It's lost the ability to record multiple exits and re entries into my work WiFi. it even misses start and end times. bye bye :(,1,2,
net.wifitimetracker,2019-01-13 05:48:28,sad i have to buy the upgrade for each phone 6 phones = 30$ other apps you pay the upgrade once and you can use the upgrade on as many phones as you want,1,0,
net.wifitimetracker,2018-10-22 19:55:57,It does not work on android 8,1,0,
net.wifitimetracker,2017-04-04 01:12:47,"Seems i cant access old backups. They just show as if nothing has been tracked. If you cant see history (1year+), then I dont really see the point.   Maybe the dev think people should export data each month, I instead made backup, with the option in the app. Mostly because i liked how it listed the data, but I guess you cant restore old data to watch it in the app.  I was really happy until i figured this out. Even paid for the app.",1,0,
net.wifitimetracker,2018-07-24 00:41:34,This app does not work well after updating to Android 8. It no longer detects wifi networks consistently throughout the day. I read this is likely due to background execution limits that are new in Android 8. This results in many gaps in the times that the app tracks throughout the day even when you have stayed connected to the same wifi network all day. I have emailed the app developer twice and they never responded.,1,1,
net.wifitimetracker,2015-11-30 07:30:23,"This app worked seamlessly for months, then one day I opened it up and all my data was lost, and I was prompted to purchase premium access (which I paid for long ago). I can't express how furious I am right now...",1,2,
net.wifitimetracker,2013-04-23 06:08:03,"It cannot count time properly! I installed it yesterday and it already shows that I've been connected to my home wi-fi for 25 hours (BULLSHIT!) plus to my office wi-fi for 9 hours, and it even doesn't count disconnected hours while I'm outside (for 5 hours)! Also it automatically turns on wi-fi receiver on the smartphone although I turn it off for a night.  Release the app AFTER you check it works properly!!!",1,1,
net.wifitimetracker,2014-04-14 16:49:32,Great idea however force closes when I open it up on my Nexus 4!,1,1,I'm sorry for the inconvenience. Please update to the latest version.
net.wifitimetracker,2013-12-02 13:26:39,There is no no export feature and data older than 6 months can't be accessed from the app.,1,2,
